/*
Delegatecall is a low-level function that lets one contract execute code from another contract in the context of the callerâ€™s storage, msg.sender, and msg.value.
If used right, delegatecall is an usefull function. The problem is when an user has much more power and he can controls the data and the lib (this is called delegatecall injection)
