/*
What is tx.origin? Ussualy people believe is the same thing with msg.sender, which is an address that tells which person/contract deployed the contract in question. But tx.origin isnâ€™t the same thing. The formal definition would be:

tx.origin = a global EVM variable that returns the original externally-owned account (EOA) that started the transaction.

But the simpler explanation is the first one that deployed the contract.
